                        When you directly provide information, such as submitting a comment, responding to an email, completing a survey, or making a purchase, we may collect personal details like email addresses, payment information, and shipping details. Not providing certain information may limit our ability to deliver products or privacyPolicy.
                        <br>
                        For certain content, such as subscription-based privacyPolicy, we require a username and password. These may be tied to other information associated with your account.
                        <br>
                        Sharing personal information with others outside of our authorized vendors is entirely up to you. For instance, if you share information in a public comment, it becomes public. Additionally, if you share details with third parties not connected to us, their privacy policies will apply to the information you provide.
                        <br>
                        We collect personal information to conduct our business and better serve you. We do not share your information with other parties unless you give us permission. We may, however, use trusted third-party service providers to support our website and privacyPolicy. These providers are not permitted to sell or transfer your information.
                        <br>
                        We also aggregate user data, which may be shared with third parties for purposes like analyzing website trends. This aggregated data does not identify individuals.
                        <br>
                        In some cases, we may be legally required to disclose your information, such as in response to legal processes or to protect our own interests (e.g., in the case of intellectual property violations).
