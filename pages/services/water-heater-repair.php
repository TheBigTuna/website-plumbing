                            Not sure if your water heater is due for a replacement? Here are some common warning signs to watch for.
                            <br>
                            If you’re hearing popping or banging noises from the tank, that’s often caused by sediment buildup and could mean the unit is struggling to function properly. 
                            You might also notice water pooling around the base of the heater or excessive moisture both signs of potential leaks or internal damage.
                        </p>           
                        <p class="servicesTexts">             
                            Another red flag is discolored or foul-smelling water, which can indicate rust or corrosion inside the tank. 
                            If you're running out of hot water faster than usual or experiencing inconsistent temperatures, your water heater may no longer be able to keep up with your household’s needs.

                <p class="servicesTexts">             
                    One of the most obvious signs is <b>a lack of hot water</b> if your system isn’t heating water at all, or the water isn't getting as hot as it once did, there could be an issue with the heating element, thermostat, or sediment buildup inside the tank.
                 </p>
                <p class="servicesTexts">             
                    <b>Inconsistent water temperatures</b> are another common red flag. 
                    If your water fluctuates from hot to cold during use, it could point to a faulty thermostat or heating element. 
                    You might also start to hear strange noises, rumbling, or banging sounds which often signal a buildup of sediment at the bottom of the tank. 
                    This can reduce efficiency and shorten the lifespan of your unit.
                </p>
                <p class="servicesTexts">             
                    <b>Leaks around the base of your water heater</b> should never be ignored. 
                    Whether it’s a leaking tank, a loose connection, or a faulty valve, water pooling around the unit is a sign that something isn’t right. 
                    Rusty or discolored hot water could mean the tank itself is corroding, which can lead to serious damage if not addressed promptly.
                </p>

                <p class="servicesTexts">             
                    Another indicator is <b>low hot water pressure</b>, which might be caused by mineral deposits clogging pipes or accumulating in the tank. If your water heater is 8 to 12 years old or older, it's also worth considering a replacement. 
                    Older units are more prone to breakdowns, and rising costs.
                </p>
                <p class="servicesTexts">             
                    If you have a gas water heater, keep an eye on the <b>pilot light</b>. 
                    A Pilot Light is a flame that flickers, goes out frequently, or appears yellow instead of blue could signal problems with the thermocouple, gas supply, or ventilation.
                </p>

                <p class="servicesTexts">             
                    Finally, if you’ve noticed a <b>spike in your energy bills</b>, your water heater could be losing efficiency. 
                    An aging or malfunctioning unit often uses more energy to produce the same amount of hot water, costing you more over time.
