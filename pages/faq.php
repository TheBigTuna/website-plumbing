                            <p class="pageText">
                                Common signs of plumbing issues include low water pressure, slow drains, gurgling sounds in pipes, water stains on walls or ceilings, unexpectedly high water bills, and foul odors coming from drains.
                                If you notice any of these symptoms, it's best to call a plumber before the problem worsens.

                            <p class="pageText">
                                If a pipe bursts in your home, turn off the main water supply immediately to prevent further flooding. 
                                Then, shut off power to any nearby electrical outlets if it’s safe to do so. 
                                Call an emergency plumber right away, and try to clean up any standing water to reduce water damage.

                            <p class="pageText">
                                We recommend scheduling a professional plumbing inspection at least once a year. 
                                Preventative maintenance can help catch small issues before they turn into major repairs, saving you money and extending the life of your plumbing system.

                            <p class="pageText">
                                Avoid flushing anything besides toilet paper down toilets, and never pour grease or oil down kitchen sinks. 
                                Use drain strainers in sinks and tubs to catch hair and debris, and regularly flush drains with hot water or a natural cleaner to keep them clear.

                            <p class="pageText">
                                Low water pressure can be caused by several issues, including clogged pipes, corroded plumbing, partially closed shut-off valves, or problems with the municipal water supply. 
                                Our team can diagnose the cause and recommend the best solution to restore normal pressure.

                                Water heaters typically last 8–12 years. You may need to replace yours sooner if you notice signs like rust colored water, strange noises, inconsistent water temperatures, or frequent repairs. 
                                We install both traditional and tankless water heaters to fit your needs.

                                A plumbing emergency in Detroit includes situations that require immediate attention to prevent property damage or safety hazards. This may include burst pipes, sewage backups, overflowing toilets, frozen or broken pipes during Michigan winters, and a total loss of water service.
                                These issues demand urgent, professional help.

                                Emergency plumbing services typically carry a higher cost due to the urgent response required, especially after hours, on weekends, or holidays.

                                First, shut off your main water supply if you can do so safely. 
                                Avoid using any plumbing fixtures. If you're experiencing a gas related plumbing issue, evacuate the property and call your gas company.

                                Yes. Regular inspections and maintenance are especially important in Detroit due to harsh winters that can freeze pipes. 
                                Avoid pouring grease down drains and have your system inspected annually to catch potential issues early.
